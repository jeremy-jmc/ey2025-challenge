- building footprint
- all channels
- proximity to vegetation (green space), proximity to water, and local urban density contributes to urban heating
-  building surface and ground surface temperatures which may contribute 
to local air heating in a UHI model (Landsat)
- high wind speeds and direction can cause mixing of near-surface air and 
reduce UHI intensity and variability
- Final recommendation:
Some suggestions for improved model performance 
include: consideration of additional datasets (Landsat LST, building footprints, weather), consideration of additional 
Sentinel-2 bands or spectral indices, proximity of satellite data features to data collection points, building density in 
proximity to data collection points, regression algorithms, and hyperparameter tuning
